## Usage

### Pámamása (Reading)

This page teaches to recognize Kulitan glyphs using digital flashcards. The progress bar for each card shows the mastery for each glyph. The circular progress bar on top of the page shows the total number of glyphs mastered (glyphs with full progress bars).

#### Switching Modes

There are two modes for this page—Romanized mode and Kulitan mode. To switch modes, click or drag the switcher on the upper right of the page. Romanized mode shows the Kulitan glyph's Romanized counterpart on the card and Kulitan glyphs as choices, while the Kulitan mode shows the Kulitan on the card and Romanized as choices.

#### Revealing the Answer

To skip a character without affecting progress, the you may reveal the answer by swiping up or down.

#### Choosing an Answer

By pressing on one of the choices below, you may either increase or decrease your mastery if your choice was correct or incorrect.

#### Dismissing a Card

To dismiss a card, swipe the card to the left. Cards may only be dismissed after revealing the answer or choosing from the choices below.

### Pámaniúlat (Writing)

This page teaches how to write Kulitan glyphs in the correct stroke order. Its glyph progress management is similar to Pámamása page's. To finish a glyph, simply follow the guides shown on the screen. The next stroke guide is shown only after completing the previous stroke.

### Pámanlíkas (Transcribe)

This page allows the two-way transcription of Kulitan and Romanized text.

#### Transcribe To Kulitan

To transcribe to Kulitan, simply type on the Romanized text input box by tapping on the Romanized portion of the card. Text will be automatically transcribed as you type on the text box.

#### Transcribe From Kulitan

Transcribing from Kulitan requires the input of glyphs in Kulitan. To type in Kulitan, use the Kulitan keyboard provided in the page. Since Kulitan is written top-to-bottom and right-to-left, the input box for Kulitan overflows to the right. This input box becomes horizontally scrollable when the glyphs overflow.

#### Using the Kulitan Keyboard

To reveal the Kulitan keyboard, tap on the Kulitan portion of the card or swipe upwards from anywhere on the card. The Kulitan keyboard has glyphs with and without diacritical marks and Clear, Delete, Add, and New Line buttons. To type a glyph, simply tap on a glyph key on the keyboard. To add a glyph with a diacritical mark on the top or bottom, swipe up or down from the glyph key. Tapping on the Clear key deletes all of the glyphs on the card. The Delete key removes each glyph subsequently. The New Line key allows the completion of a glyph block and moving onto a new column for the glyphs. The Add key functions only whenever the current glyph has a vowel. It makes the vowel of the current glyph longer by adding a vowel glyph in the glyph block.

### Kapabaluan (Information)

The main Kapabaluan page shows tables of Indûng Súlat and Anak Súlat glyphs. It also contains two more informative pages, namely History and Writing Guide pages.

### Kalalangan (Artworks)

This page showcases a variety of Kulitan artworks. Analyze the style and handwriting of numerous artists. These artworks use a wide variety of mediums such as digital, t-shirts, wood, paper, concrete, and glass. Tap on an artist's name to view his/her other works.

### Kasaddian (Settings)
